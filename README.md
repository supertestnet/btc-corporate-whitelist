# Good BTC groups
A list of bitcoin groups whom I consider "good actors"

# Criteria
I consider a bitcoin group good if it meets these conditions:
- The group does not sell any altcoins (but see footnote 1)
- The group has publicly recommended against holding or using altcoins and does not hold or use altcoins themselves (but see footnotes 1 and 2)
- The group does not sell user data
- The group does not raise money by fooling investors
- The group does not give promotional opportunities to scammers or altcoin groups, not even in return for sponsorships, money, or "free" gifts (but see footnote 3)
- Pick at least one:
  - The group sells goods or services for bitcoin
  - The group gives away bitcoin related goods or services for free
  - The group pays at least one person to develop bitcoin software

Footnote 1: a group can be on this list even if they recommend, sell, hold, or otherwise use the following altcoins: "normal" fiat currency (not tokenized via any cryptocurrency techniques) and "wrapped bitcoins" on other platforms

Footnote 2: a group can be on this list even if they test altcoins and their apps as part of research or experimentation, and even if they acquire altcoins temporarily to assist with sending bitcoin. For example, a bitcoin wallet could do a swap to let its bitcoin holders pay a merchant that only accepts monero, even if, during that transaction, the wallet sells some bitcoin for enough monero to pay the merchant plus any requisite transaction fees. But keeping a long-term "reserve" of altcoins for such cases is grounds for exclusion from this list

Footnote 3: a group can be on this list even if they accept speaking engagements, gifts, or money from scammers and altcoin groups, and even if they participate in events organized by scammers and altcoin groups, but not if their participation suggests that the group endorses a scam or recommends an altcoin

# Modifying the list or criteria

Please open a github issue on this document if you think the list of groups should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a group) or my criteria should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a criterion)
