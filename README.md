# Good BTC groups
A list of bitcoin groups whom I consider "good actors"

# Criteria
I consider a bitcoin group good if it meets these conditions:
- The group does not sell any altcoins (but see footnote 1)
- The group has publicly recommended against holding altcoins (but see footnotes 1 and 2)
- The group does not sell user data
- Pick at least one:
  - The group sells goods or services for bitcoin
  - The group gives away free goods or services for bitcoin
  - The group pays at least one person to develop bitcoin software

Footnote 1: a group can be on this list even if they recommend, sell, hold, or otherwise use the following altcoins: "normal" fiat currency (not tokenized via any cryptocurrency techniques) and "wrapped bitcoins" on other platforms

Footnote 2: a group can be on this list even if they test altcoins and their apps as part of research or experimentation

# Modifying the list or criteria

Please open a github issue on this document if you think the list of groups should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a group) or my criteria should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a criterion)
