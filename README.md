# Good BTC groups
A list of bitcoin groups whom I consider "good actors"

# Criteria
I consider a bitcoin group good if it meets these conditions:
- The group does not sell any altcoins, unless the altcoins are "normal" USD or "wrapped bitcoins" on other platforms
- The group has publicly recommended against selling or using altcoins other than "normal" USD or "wrapped bitcoins" on other platforms, except for experimental purposes (e.g. testing an ether lending platform as part of a research project is fine)
- The group does not sell user data
- Pick at least one:
  - The group sells goods or services for bitcoin
  - The group gives away free goods or services for bitcoin
  - The group pays at least one person to develop bitcoin software

# Modifying the list or criteria

Please open a github issue on this document if you think the list of groups should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a group) or my criteria should be modified (e.g. to add or remove a criterion)
